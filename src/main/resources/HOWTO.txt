This HOWTO describes how to use the installer scripts to load SNOMED into a database.

Installation
------------
1.  Download the SNOMED CT Release files in ZIP format.  US Users can find the files here:
	- SNOMED CT® US Edition Release Files: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/us_edition.html
	- SNOMED CT® International Edition Release Files: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/international.html

2.  Open the desired zip file and extract the 'SNAPSHOT' folder into a temp-folder

3.  Update this project's pom.xml to contain the proper editionVersion for each profile ('INT' or 'US' for SNOMED-CORE or US-Edition respectively)

4.  Build this project with maven (mvn install) referencing the appropriate profile

5.  Depending on your database and edition, identify the appropriate target's zip file. For example:
  * For MySql SNOMED-CORE, use the "snomed-db-scripts-mysql.20180731.zip" file
  * For MySql US-Edition, use the "snomed-db-scripts-mysql.20180931.zip" file
  * For Oracle SNOMED-CORE, use the "snomed-db-scripts-oracle.20180731.zip" file
  * For Oracle US-Edition, use the "snomed-db-scripts-oracle.20180931.zip" file
  Where the editionVersion for INT is 20180731 and the editionVersion for US is 20180931

6. Open the desired zip file and extract the contents of the 'rf2' folder into the same temp-folder temp-folder

7. Validate the temp-folder has the proper content:
  * The 'Snapshot' folder from Step #2
  * The contents of the 'rf2' folder from Step #6

8.  In a text editor, open the temp-folder's appropriate "populate" script in a text editor as defined by your platform and database.  For example:
  * For MySQL on Windows, use the "populate_mysql_db.bat" script
  * For Oracle on Windows, use the "populate_oracle_db.bat" script
  * For MySQL on Linux/Unix/MacOS, use the "populate_mysql_db.sh" script
  * For Oracle on Linux/Unix/MacOS, use the "populate_oracle_db.sh" script
 
9. Configure the settings at the top of the "populate" script for your environment
	- user (with your database's username)
	- password (with your database's password)
	- db_name (with the name of the database schema you wish to populate)
	
10. Create the database schema as defined in step #9

11. Execute the "populate" script 
  * Note: a complete log file will appear as "mysql.log" or "oracle.log"
