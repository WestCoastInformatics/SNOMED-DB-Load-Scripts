This HOWTO describes how to use the installer scripts to load SNOMED into a database.

0.  Download the SNOMED CT International Release files 
    in ZIP format.  US Users can find the files here:
	• SNOMED CT® International Edition Release Files 
	  - http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctfiles.html
	• SNOMED CT® International Edition Archive Files 
	  - http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctarchive.html

    OR 
       
    Download the SNOMED CT US Edition Release files 
    in ZIP format.  US Users can find the files here:
	• SNOMED CT® US Edition Release Files 
	  - http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/us_edition.html

1.  Unzip the files into a folder 
    (e.g. SnomedCT_Release_${editionLabel}_${editionVersion}).

2.  Unzip the installer scripts.

3.  For the desired format, copy the appropriate installer scripts 
    to the release file subdirectory specified below:
	• To install from RF1, copy the installer scripts from rf1/
	  and paste them into 
	  SnomedCT_Release_${editionLabel}_${editionVersion}/RF1Release.
	• To install from RF2, copy the installer scripts from rf2/
	  and paste them into 
	  SnomedCT_Release_${editionLabel}_${editionVersion}/RF2Release.

4.  Set the variables in the script, such as database username/
    password.

5.  Depending on your platform and database, execute the 
    appropriate "populate" script.  For example:
	• For MySQL on Windows, double-click the 
	  "populate_mysql_db.bat" script.
	• For Oracle on Windows, double-click the 
	  "populate_oracle_db.bat" script.
	• For MySQL on Linux/Unix/MacOS, open a terminal and run the 
	  "populate_mysql_db.sh" script.
	• For Oracle on Linux/Unix/MacOS, open a terminal and run the 
	  "populate_oracle_db.sh" script.

    Note: a complete log file will appear as "mysql.log" or 
    "oracle.log", depending on your choice.
