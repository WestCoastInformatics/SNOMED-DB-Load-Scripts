This HOWTO describes how to use the installer scripts to load SNOMED into a database.

Installation
------------
1.  Download the SNOMED CT International Release files 
    in ZIP format.  US Users can find the files here:
  * SNOMED CT® US Edition Release Files: 
    * http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/us_edition.html
  * SNOMED CT® International Edition Release Files: 
    * http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctfiles.html
  * SNOMED CT® International Edition Archive Files
    * http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/snomedctarchive.html

2.  Unzip the files into a folder 

3.  Unzip the installer scripts.

4.  For the desired format, copy the appropriate installer scripts 
    to the release file directory as specified below:
* To install from RF1, copy the installer scripts from rf1/
	  and paste them into the RF1 directory you unzipped in step 2
* To install from RF2, copy the installer scripts from rf2/
	  and paste them into the RF2 directory you unzipped in step 2

5.  Set the variables in the script, such as database username/password.

6.  Depending on your platform and database, execute the 
    appropriate "populate" script.  For example:
  * For MySQL on Windows, double-click the 
	  "populate_mysql_db.bat" script.
  * For Oracle on Windows, double-click the 
	  "populate_oracle_db.bat" script.
  * For MySQL on Linux/Unix/MacOS, open a terminal and run the 
	  "populate_mysql_db.sh" script.
  * For Oracle on Linux/Unix/MacOS, open a terminal and run the 
	  "populate_oracle_db.sh" script.
  * Note: a complete log file will appear as "mysql.log" or "oracle.log"
