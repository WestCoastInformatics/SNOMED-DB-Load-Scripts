This HOWTO describes how to use the installer scripts to load SNOMED into a database.

Installation
------------
1.  Download the SNOMED CT Release files 
    in ZIP format.  US Users can find the files here:
  * SNOMED CT® US Edition Release Files: 
    * https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/us_edition.html
  * SNOMED CT® International Edition Release Files: 
    * https://www.nlm.nih.gov/healthit/snomedct/international.html

2.  Unzip the files into a folder

3.  Unzip the installer scripts to another folder

4.  For the desired format, copy the appropriate installer scripts 
    to the release file directory as specified below:
* For RF2, copy the installer scripts from rf2/ to the folder from step 2

5.  Depending on your platform and database, choose the 
    appropriate "populate" script.  For example:
  * For MySQL on Windows, use the "populate_mysql_db.bat" script
  * For Oracle on Windows, use the "populate_oracle_db.bat" script
  * For MySQL on Linux/Unix/MacOS, use the "populate_mysql_db.sh" script
  * For Oracle on Linux/Unix/MacOS, use the "populate_oracle_db.sh" script
  
6. Configure the settings at the top of the script for your environment

7. Execute the script
  * Note: a complete log file will appear as "mysql.log" or "oracle.log"
