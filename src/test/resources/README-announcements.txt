Hi all,

NLM recently posted the September 01, 2024 update of the SNOMEDCT US Edition.

For those interested in interacting with SNOMEDCT data through a relational database,
we have a utility to make it easy to load the data into a Postgres, Oracle, MySQL (or MariaDB) database.
We offer support for both International Edition and the US Edition.

This utility is freely available through our website:
